            <p> Roopkund is a famous glacial lake in the state of Uttarakhand in India. This lake is famous due to more
                than five hundred skeletons of humans that are found at the edge of the lake. It is located in the
                Himalayas and rests at an altitude of nearly 4,800 meters. Roopkund is located in the Chamoli district
                of Garhwal. It is one of the best sites for Trekking in Garhwal. It is closer to hill stations like
                Nainital and Kathgodam. At a distance of 217 km from Nainital and 235 km from Kathgodam, Roopkund is one
                of the major adventure attractions for people in the country and those traveling from abroad. Roopkund,
                which is located in the lap of Trishul massif is also known as the ‘mystery lake’. You can find human
                skeletons at the bank of the lake, which are believed to belong to the Palaeolithic age.
                These are believed to be the skeletons of the heroes who had fought here in earlier times. Along with
                the skeletons of humans, you can also find the skeletal structure of horses and other animals. There are
                reports that these skeletons belong to the 12th century to the 15th century. It is believed by
                specialists that the death of many people in this region was a result of landslides, blizzards, or an
                epidemic. The human skeletons were re-discovered in 1942 by H K Madhwal, who was a Nanda Devi Game
                reserve ranger.

                Later in 2004, a team of Indian scientists along with some Europeans visited the area to gain more
                information about the nature of the skeletons. , also known as the Mystery Lake, is famous for its
                skeletal remains visible at the bottom of the lake. This challenging trek offers breathtaking views of
                the Himalayas, including Nanda Devi and Trishul peaks. The trek passes through beautiful forests,
                meadows, and snow-covered terrain.

            <p>The Hampta Pass trek offers a diverse landscape, from lush green valleys of Kullu to the barren terrain
                of Lahaul.
                <img src="hampa5.jpg" alt="Hampta Pass Trek" height="300" width="500">   <img src="hampata5.jpg" alt="Hampta Pass Trek" height="300" width="500">
                This trek is known for its dramatic change in scenery and the beautiful crescent-shaped Chandratal Lake. At 14,000 feet Hampta Pass
                in Himachal Pradesh falls under those rare, dramatic pass crossings in the Himalayas. On one side is the
                lush green valley of Kullu — with forests, grasslands, and flowers blooming on the side of your trail.
                On the other is the almost arid, stark landscape of Lahaul, with barren mountains and almost no
                vegetation. Standing on the top of the pass, what’s ahead and behind are two different worlds. It
                changes in a matter of minutes.
                Simply put,the Hampta Pass is Himachal’s Valley of Flowers. The landscape is strikingly similar to that
                of Valley of Flowers – a green narrow valley protected by snow-covered mountains – but there’s a bonus
                here.
                When you get onto the other side of the Hampta Pass, you’ll be in awe looking at the stark contrast from
                what you just left behind. The landscape that stretches in front of you is Spiti Valley, known for its
                barren stretches, rugged terrain and forget-me-not blue skies.
                What makes the dramatic changes heightened, even more, is how thrilling the climb to Hampta Pass is. For
                trekkers, crossing the Hampta Pass (even without the scenery changes) is a great story of adventure.
                They will love the nervous excitement of climbing to the pass over many ledges, almost appearing to get
                to the pass, but never really sure until you get there.

            <h2>4. Goechala Trek, Sikkim</h2>
            <img src="goechala.jpg" alt="Goechala Trek" height="600" width="800">
            <div class="info">

            <img src="sunrise1" alt="Goechala Trek" height="300" width="300"> <img src="sunrise2" alt="Goechala Trek"
                height="300" width="350">
            <p>The biggest reason to do the Goechala trek is the grand views of the big mountains you see. You don’t
                just see one summit — the Kanchenjunga — but 14 other big summits. That’s a lot for any trek —
                especially as close to the eyes as on the Goechala trek. It is no wonder that trekkers consider Goechala
                to be the closest to the big mountain treks of Nepal.

                Before we dive into the details about the Goechala trek, here is a little backdrop of why Goechala is
                well-known among trekkers all over the world:

                While the trail to Goechala is old, it wasn’t always so famous. The change that occurred during the
                Nepalese Civil War lasted from 1996 to 2006.

                Disturbances in Nepal during this time shut the country to trekkers. Suddenly trekking to the highest
                mountains of the world was out of bounds. It was a massive blow to the trekkers, who frantically started
                looking for alternatives.

                At that time, Goechala emerged as the closest solace. The trail promised a brilliant close-up of the
                third highest mountain in the world and offered breathtaking views of the Singalila range from Dzongri
                Top.

                Sunrise on the Kanchenjunga Range

                One of the biggest highlights of the Goechala trek is the sunrise scene on the Kanchenjunga range. Even
                though trekkers are not allowed to the actual Goecha Pass, the view from ViewPoint 1 and Dzongri is
                worth an arm and a leg!

                Rhododendrons in April and May
                <img src="rohdodendrons.jpg" alt="Goechala Trek" height="300" width="300"> <img src="2Rhododendron.jpg"
                    alt="Goechala Trek" height="300" width="300">

                The trail to Goechala is blessed with rhododendron forests. And come spring-summer months of April and
                May, they burst to life with pink and red flowers! It’s an enormously pleasant walk through the
                wooden-log trails of these jungles!

                The Samiti Lake
                <img src="lake 1.jpg" alt="Goechala Trek" height="400" width="300"> <img src="lake2.jpg"
                    alt="Goechala Trek" height="400" width="300">
                Samiti Lake is another big attraction on the Goechala trek. The view of the still waters, and the
                reflection of Mt Pandim in the lake, especially in the early hours, is a visual treat.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Close views of Kanchenjunga, Samiti Lake, diverse Himalayan flora and fauna.

            </div>
            <p>The Markha Valley trek is one of the most popular treks in Ladakh, offering a glimpse into the unique
                culture of the region.
                The trek passes through traditional Ladakhi villages, Buddhist monasteries, and high mountain passes.
                Markha is a stunning river valley in Hemis National Park. The trek through Markha Valley is very
                picturesque and full of adventure.
                The trek involves many river crossings, some waist-deep, along with taking you to a hight of 17,060ft
                while crossing the high pass of Kongmaru La. The trail offers some outstanding views of Mt Kang Yatse
                (21,300 ft). There are also incredible rocky canyons along the trail, as well as plenty of wildlife.
                The most charming bit of this trek however is the lovely villages of Markha Valley. The humble mud
                houses set amidst lush green fields are a spectacular sight in the middle of the barren mountains of
                Ladakh. Tibetan culture thrives in these villages, with traditional ornamented kitchens and Buddhist
                prayer flags, among other things Tibetan.
                The best part of it is that you can stay in such lovely homes throughout the trek. There are village
                homestays all throughout the trail which make Markha Valley one of the few tea-house treks in India.
                This makes the trek a very rewarding experience, without the logistics involved in camping. </p>
            <p><strong>Highlights:</strong> Hemis National Park, ancient monasteries, traditional Ladakhi culture,
                diverse landscapes.</p>
